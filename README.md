# ECE 276A: Stop Sign Detection
Stop sign detection algorithm using logistic regression for color segmentation and OpenCV for shape recognition

## Code:
LogisticRegression.ipynb - program used to train Logistic Regression model and get model parameters. 
  
stop_sign_detector.py - program used to segment images and find bounding boxes of stop sign like regions. 
  
getROI.py - program used to make binary mask labels for training and validation sets. 
  
Report.pdf - project report containing examples of segmentation and bounding boxes. 

## Results:
